Figured out a way to create the descending names for the categories in the chart. Have not tested it w/ up to four categories yet tho. Should work for an endless # of categores, which is not following assignment requirements. Needs tested. Need to add chart building logic to that function as well.

Worked on the spend chart more. Need to add the parts where it adds the descending category names, then I will work on the process of filling the chart. Has not been tested w/ the assignment's test script on repl.it yet, so results may vary and I may still have a long way to go.

Messed up something; need to use the check_funds() method per the project req's. Going to change to doing that. Committing these changes as it seems like things work so far? code underneath the class is from the project's main.py file for testing, and I'm using it for the ease of debugging.

Wrote some of the class methods. Have not tested them yet, so they will likely all need work. Hopefully, the comments in the code reflect the changes that have been made so far and those that still need to be made.

Created the basic outline for the class. Have not written any functions yet. Still planning.
