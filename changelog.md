Messed up something; need to use the check_funds() method per the project req's. Going to change to doing that. Committing these changes as it seems like things work so far? code underneath the class is from the project's main.py file for testing, and I'm using it for the ease of debugging.

Wrote some of the class methods. Have not tested them yet, so they will likely all need work. Hopefully, the comments in the code reflect the changes that have been made so far and those that still need to be made.

Created the basic outline for the class. Have not written any functions yet. Still planning.
