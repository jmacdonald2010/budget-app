# budget-app
This project was completed in part for freeCodeCamp's Scientific Computing in Python course. 

## What does it do?

This python file creates a class called "Category," to create a simple budget app. The category class has a name and several methods that represent typical real-world transactions. The class has methods to represent deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, and methods to calculate the balance and check funds. If the object is printed, then it returns a ledger showing deposits and withdrawals, along with a total balance. 

The "create spend chart" function takes a list of categories as an argument and then calculates a simple graph to show what percent of the total withdrawals each category represents, rounded down to the nearest 10%
